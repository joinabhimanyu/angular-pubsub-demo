//Issues as on 24th Oct 2018
                        1. In typical sequence of Q1.1 as 2, 1.2 as 5, 1.3 as 3, q1.4a-d as 1, Q2 as 3,
                            Then I go back to Q1.1 and answer 1.
                        2. The use-case:
                                1) Patient skips through the questionnaire (answering no questions) until patient concerns
                                2) Patient specifies several patient concerns
                                3) Patient closes the application
                                4) Patient returns to the questionnaire and presses ‘next’
                                A ‘Cannot read property ‘score’ error appears.
